# Substrate Cumulus Parachain

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node.
This is a simple implemention of the parachain using Substrate framework in Polkadot.

This project uses the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to a **relay chain**.
